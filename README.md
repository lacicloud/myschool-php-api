# myschool-php-api
A PHP API for some functions of the MySchool school managment software. Uses web scraping to gather information. Only parent login is officially supported,
but it should give you a starting point to extend the library. Please note that I had to increase the max input size in the simple HTML dom configuration. 
Enjoy!
